# A comprehensive study on the indicative factors of Diabetes Mellitus using machine learning

## About

This is a mini project for SC5010 (Introduction to Data Analysis) which focuses on how diabetes in different countries can be grouped together using machine learning and how their macroindicators can be used to classify the different diabetes trends observed across the countries. The notebook can be viewed in the following order: 
1) Timeseries analysis of diabetes trend
2) Data cleaning for the macroindicators
3) Random forest modelling
