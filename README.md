# A comprehensive study on the indicative factors of Diabetes Mellitus using machine learning

## About

This is a mini project for SC5010 (Introduction to Data Analysis) which focuses on how diabetes in different countries can be grouped together using machine learning and how their macroindicators can be used to classify the different diabetes trends observed across the countries. The notebook can be viewed in the following order: 
1) Timeseries analysis and clustering of diabetes trend
2) Data cleaning for the macroindicators
3) Random forest modelling 

## Contributers
@ Lim Yi Yang - involved in the neural network (self organizing maps (SOM) for time series clustering and analysis of the different diabetes trend. 
@ Leong Say Hao - involved in data cleaning of the macroindicators and primary EDA analysis.
@ Koh Tiang Guan Bernard - involved in Random Tree modeling and insights derivation. 

## Problem definition
1) Is there any common pattern of the diabetes trend observed across the different countries? 
2) Could the macroindicators (which describes the state of a country's economy) be used to classify the diabetes trend? 

## Models used 
1) Self Organizing Maps (SOM). https://github.com/JustGlowing/minisom
2) Random forest modelling.
